# -Syntecxhub_-Correlation-heatmap-pairwise-relationships
The goal of this project is to analyze relationships between multiple numerical variables using correlation coefficients and visual data exploration techniques. By examining correlations and pairwise plots, we can uncover how different features influence each other â€” an essential step in data analysis and predictive modeling.
