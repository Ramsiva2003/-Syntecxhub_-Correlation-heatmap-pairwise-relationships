# -Syntecxhub_-Correlation-heatmap-pairwise-relationships
The goal of this project is to analyze relationships between multiple numerical variables using correlation coefficients and visual data exploration techniques. By examining correlations and pairwise plots, we can uncover how different features influence each other â€” an essential step in data analysis and predictive modeling.
Tools & Libraries

Python 3

Pandas â†’ for data handling and correlation computation

NumPy â†’ for numerical operations

Matplotlib â†’ for custom plotting

Seaborn â†’ for heatmap and pairplot visualizations

ðŸ§® Dataset

The dataset used is synthetically generated to simulate real-world business metrics.
It includes:

Advertising_Spend: Amount spent on advertisements

Product_Price: Price per product

Customer_Rating: Customer satisfaction rating (1â€“5 scale)

Website_Visits: Number of website visitors

Units_Sold: Quantity of units sold

Revenue: Total income generated (correlated with price and units sold)

This makes the project fully self-contained (no external CSV required).
